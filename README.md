# Hi, 👋 I am Dharmen Shah.

## I am a 👔👨🏻‍💻 Front-end Developer.

### I like to work on 💻 Web stuff (HTML, CSS, JS), 🅰️ Angular, ⚛️ React, 🖌️ Bootstrap.

### I also love 🤗 to contribute to 👐 Open-Source Projects and sometime ✒️ write 📜 articles.

## Over the past 6 years,

I've worked in different companies on different roles, ranging from support to developer to team-lead.

Right now, I am working as Sr. Front-end Developer at [Milestone Inc.](http://milestoneinternet.com/), crafting their suit of products for a global customer-base to provide fast, reliable and robust solutions. Mainly I am working on Angular, SCSS and Bootstrap here, I love that stack.

Before that, I was Full Stack Developer at [Quark Studios](http://quarkstudios.com/). I am (maybe was) responsible for front part of an enterprise web application. I learned, and worked on React.

I once also led frontend team at a Hyderabadi startup, Conifer labs. We were building a solid GST Portal there, for all the platforms, web, desktop, tablet, mobile, and offline too. I actually started my professional development journey from here.

Before that I was in a support and maintenance project at an MNC, for 3 years. I was working on SAP WEBI/BI and Tableau.
